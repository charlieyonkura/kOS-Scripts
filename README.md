# kOS-Scripts

Dates: Jun 2021 - Aug 2021

This project features a program which automatically launches a rocket and places it into a stable, circular orbit in the video game Kerbal Space Program. This game features a mod called "kerboscript", which adds a proprietary programming language to automate simple spaceship tasks.

This project features a sequential, function-oriented design which could be adapted to other in-game scenarios. This project also required the use of the Rocket Equation, among other calculus-based equations, to calculate the duration of the rocket firing required to circularize the orbit.
This was my first project which I completed collaboratively. My friend was also interested in creating automation in this game, so he helped derive the equations and write the code. I learned a lot about GitHub and version control over the course of this project.
